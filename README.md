### Class

All classes are stored here and initialized via autoloader in init.php.

### Headfoot

Persistently used headers and footers stored here.

-   Header

        -   database.php for all database connections.
    -   $database creates a new Database object to query off of in all files with the header.
    -   Functions:

### HTML

-   **delete**: Prompts user to choose to delete their account or not.
-   **drag**: A simple drag and drop example using HTML and JS drag and drop API as well as AJAX to update the database without resetting the page.
-   **homepage**: Landing page for logged in users. Provides access to perfume tracker, edit, delete, and logout. If they click logout, the session is killed and the header is switched to index.php.
-   **login**: Basic login for users. Populates errors if queries come back null.
-   **register**: Registration form. Populates errors if queries come back with information in them already (username or email is taken). Validation takes place in several stages here.
-   **update**: Allows users to update any of their information.

### PHP

-   **ajax**: Receives information regarding the ID of the item moved and the landing zone. Updates the JSON object in the database to represent where each item is located in the drag and drop.
-   **delete_action**: If user confirms deletion the session is killed, their account is deleted from the users DB, and the header is switched to index.php.
-   **homepage_action**: Redirects user to different locations and programmatically generates a homepage photo based on the users wishlist. If no wishlist is found, uses the full list of perfumes.
-   **login_action**: Checks if entered username and password match info in DB. If they do, a session is created and the user is redirected to loggedin.php.
-   **register_action**: Populates errors if queries come back with information in them already (username or email is taken). Validation takes place in several stages here. If no errors, session is started and user is redirected to loggedin.php.
-   **updateinfo_action**: Shows user information from queried DB to provide up to date information. Validation takes place in several stages here. If no errors, $\_SESSION['username'] is overwritten with updated username to provide continual queries. User is sent to loggedin.
